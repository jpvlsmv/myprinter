# myprinter
Marlin firmware for my particular 3D printer

## Usage:
I got it mostly working and tested in the `compiletest` branch, now `mainline` is where the work needs to happen.

## TODO:
Probably want to remind myself what I did to the base Marlin code to make it work, and notes at some point.
